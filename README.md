# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my Remix Medusa example repository.

The main branch here will have all of the "final" code you need to pull down to see the example. This is being created for a talk on Remix, so I won't dive too deep into the Medusa code. I'm not including the Medusa Admin (https://github.com/medusajs/admin), but it could be included as an app in this monorepo also.
